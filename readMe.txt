To run the project :
For running the api
1. Make sure you first start the server. For starting the server, put the files inside of 'other' folder out of that 
folder and place them on directory up (the MVC folder).
2. In the app.js file, open the terminal, making sure the terminal is at the current directory(where the app.js is located)
3. run these commands sequentially:
 a.npm install
 b. npm start
DONE! The server will start running and we will have the api working.

For running next.js app:


1. Run these commands in the terminal sequentially, making sure your current dir is at the project folder.
 a.npm install
 b.npm run dev
The frontend will start running and communicating with backend APIs.
